# Time Dilation Calculator (Complete)
*Is there a sweet spot with travel velocity in relation to time dilation?*

### What is this?

This is an exploration and compilation of ideas relative to time dilation. I document my discoveries
and my thought process throughout the experiment. I explain to the viewer what is going on and explain how I got there.

### What is the goal?

My original hypothesis was that there is some kind of "sweet spot" within the time dilation formula in which there must
be an optimal speed for space travel. I was messing around with a time dilation calculator online when I had a couple
realizations. One, is that it is possible to go farther in a given relative amount of time while going slower in speed.
Two, there did not exist an online calculator or visual representation of what I was trying to prove.

This is a project I started for fun. I am by no means an expert on time dilation, physics, or mathematics. However, I
tried my best to be as accurate as possible.

So, with this project complete, the question is: Was my hypothesis true?
